In this project, we implemented two algorithms for collaborative filtering from scratch: Gradient Descent with Probabilistic Assumtptions (A2 in the assignment) and Alternating Least Squares (A3). Afterwards, we used Kernel Ridge Regression (P3) for post-processing. Our results indicate that KRR is a valuable improvement for the algorithms. Also, we found that the more latent factors we use, the lower the final RMSE. Overall, ALS tends to outperform GD with Probabilistic Assumptions for all levels of latent factors on the the test data.

**Contribution statement**: 
+ Fateme Sadat Haghpanah: implemented algorithm A2 (Gradient Descent with Probabilistic Assumptions). Created the p and q matrix resulted by this algorithm for different factor sizes. Helped on completing the A2 algorithm part of main.Rmd
+ Stefano Longo: implemented postprocessing and model evaluation. Responsible for repository cleaning and supported creation of final report.
+ Tim Schleicher: implemented algorithm A2 (Gradient Descent with Probabilistic Assumptions). Created the and q matrix resulted by this algorithm for different factor sizes. Pulled together all components of the project to build the final report.
+ Stephanie Wong: implement A3 algorithm (Alternating Least Squares)
+ Nuanjun Zhao: Mainly post processing and evaluation part. Worked with Stefano, came up with how krr works and discussed about post processing with krr with him. Write 90% codes for A2 and A3 Krr and Evaluation. Run the codes and get the results for A3. Write the report for postprocessing and evaluation. Help with presentation.
